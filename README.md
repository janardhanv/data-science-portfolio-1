- ### Regression
	- Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a real value, like salary for example. If your independent variable is time, then you are forecasting future values, otherwise your model is predicting present but unknown values. Regression technique vary from Linear Regression to SVR and Random Forests Regression.
	-  In this i have implemented the following Machine Learning Regression models:
      	-   __Simple Linear Regression__
      	-   __Multiple Linear Regression__
      	-   __Polynomial Regression__
      	-   __Support Vector for Regression__
      	-   __Decision Tree Classification__
      	-   __Random Forest Classification__
      
- ### Classification
	- Unlike regression where you predict a continuous number, you use classification to predict a category. There is a wide variety of classification applications from medicine to marketing. Classification models include linear models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and nonlinear ones like K-NN, Kernel SVM and Random Forests.
	-  In this i have implemented the following Machine Learning Regression models:
      	-   __Logistic Regression__
      	-   __K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)__
      	-   __Support Vector Machine (SVM)__
      	-   __Kernel SVM__
      	-   __Naive Bayes__
      	-   __Decision Tree Classification__
      	-   __Random Forest Classification__
      
- ### Clustering
	- Clustering is similar to classification, but the basis is different. In Clustering we don’t know what we are looking for, and we are trying to identify some segments or clusters in our data. When we use clustering algorithms on our dataset, unexpected things can suddenly pop up like structures, clusters and groupings we would have never thought of otherwise.
	-  In this i have implemented the following Machine Learning Clustering models:
     	-    __K-Means Clustering__
        -    __Hierarchical Clustering__
        
- ### Association Rule Learning
	- Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases.
	-  In this i have implemented the following Machine Learning Association Rule Learning models:
       	-  __Apriori__
      
- ### Natural Language Processing
	- Natural Language Processing (or NLP) is applying Machine Learning models to text and language. Teaching machines to understand what is said in spoken and written word is the focus of Natural Language Processing. Whenever you dictate something into your iPhone / Android device that is then converted to text, that’s an NLP algorithm in action.
	-  In this i have implemented the following Machine Learning NLP models:
      	-  __Create a Bag of Words model__  
	
- ### Deep Learning
	- Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.
	-  In this i have implemented the following Supervised Deep Learning models:
      	-   __Logistic Regression__
      	-   __K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)__
      	-   __Support Vector Machine (SVM)__
      	-   __Kernel SVM__
      	-   __Naive Bayes__
      	-   __Decision Tree Classification__
      	-   __Random Forest Classification__
